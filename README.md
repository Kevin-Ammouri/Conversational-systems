# Calendar Bot
By Kevin Ammouri, Lucas HÃ¶glund, Arian Javdan

Project at KTH for the course Conversational Systems. This is our take on a
calendar bot for scheduling, listing and removing events on furhatOS using
Google Calendar. The bot is context-aware as well as proactive. 
The bot is speech-only.
